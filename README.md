# hosmium

A Discord bot that will hopefully do things.

## Setup

1. Create a file called `config.json` in the hosmium's root directory (where `main.js` is located)
2. Open it and paste this inside:
   ```
   {
       "prefix": "h!",
       "token": "PUT YOUR BOT'S TOKEN HERE",
       "commandsDirectory": "./commands",
       "botLogoImage": "https://example.com/image.png"
   }
   ```
3. Make modifications as you see fit
4. Run `main.js` with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v15 or higher)
